# Lightsaber
A lightsaber is a fictional energy sword featured in the Star Wars franchise. This project is a simulation of a lightsaber using LEDs, Sound and an Arduino microcontroller. It is based on the Gyversaber. https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Based-Lightsaber-With-Light-and-Sound-Effe/

## Files

ArduinoCode : GyverSaber/GyverSaber/Gyversaber.ino

SD Files : GyverSaber/SDsounds

Schemes: PCB/


## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To use this project, you will need the following:

Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/software)
•	Arduino NANO 
•	Adressable LED stripes WS2811, 12V
•	Button with LED 
•	MPU6050 
•	DF-Player
•	Batteries 18650 with Protection
•	DCDC Step-Down
•	Speaker
•	Resistors
•	Power button
•	Charging port
•	CC CV Charger for 3 cells
•	PCB-Board
•	Blade Pipe
•	PVC Pipes for hilt
•	Wire
•	3D druck
•	Soldering Supplies
I chose to use an PCB aswell you can configure it with my files on JLCPCB

### Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/CarolynJansing/Lightsaber.git
Open the Arduino IDE and open the Gyversaber.ino file from the cloned repository.
Connect the Arduino microcontroller to your computer using a USB cable.
Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE (Tools > Board and Tools > Port).
Upload the code to the Arduino microcontroller.
### Usage
The lightsaber can be controlled by the button. The buttons can be used to turn the lightsaber on and off, change the color of the lightsaber, and change the lightsaber mode.

## Built With
Arduino Nano following the Gyversaber Instructions and changed to a DFPlayer
